# Counter Trafficking Data Collaborative (CTDC) North American Analysis

# Introduction
I wanted to approach a gravitational, social science based problem for this analysis. My motivation in working with this specific dataset is the goal of identifying critical risk factors in vulnerable populations across North America (Mexico, The United States, and Canada). If contexts in which a certain population experiences increased vulnerability to trafficking are identified, this awareness could inform policy and increase public awareness.  

Working with human trafficking data requires more than technological prowess, but sensitivity to the biases embedded in the data and in the analyst themselves. Before beginning this analysis, I would like to start by discussing how the data is collected and addressing biases before delving into the analysis.

## The Data:

The data: [https://www.ctdatacollaborative.org/dataset/global-synthetic-data-and-resources/resource/microdata]
The codebook: [https://www.ctdatacollaborative.org/dataset/global-synthetic-data-and-resources/resource/codebook]
About Page: [https://www.ctdatacollaborative.org/page/global-synthetic-dataset]

This data contains "critical information on the socio-demographic profile of victims, types of exploitation, and the trafficking process, including means of control used". Containing "over 222,000 victims and survivors of trafficking identified across 197 countries and territories from 2002 to 2023". 

Now I will identify biases and justify some analytical decisions made later on. This is not a complete list of the biases inherint in tasks like this, however it is the three that I found to be most domineering in the literature. 

### I. Population Biases: 

Due to the global nature of this dataset, it is important to follow previous literature in the field's understanding of how different cultures view exploitation differently. Because of this, I have restricted my analysis to the countries of North America in order to most closly align the notion of exploitation with my own. However, that does not mean this bias is irradicated, mearly mitigated.
